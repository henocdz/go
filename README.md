# Learning Go 

I have had some free time at work and I decided to invest it on learning Go, it's been almost three years since the first I heard of Go and I wanted to learn it... never is too late so here I am.

I started with: [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com)

Over the process I have been searching on Google to understand some parts of the language so in the comments you will find some links to blog posts, Stack Overflow questions, etc.

Note: I didn't create a file for each lesson of Go By Example.

Happy coding! :)
